def random_array(arr):
    """
    Fill an array with random integers using an external command-line tool.

    This function takes an existing list `arr` and replaces each element with a
    random integer generated by invoking the `shuf` command-line tool. The random
    integers are generated in the range of 1 to 20.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of integers, which will be overwritten with random values.

    Returns:
        list: The modified list with random integers replacing the original elements.

    Example:
        random_array([0, 0, 0])
        [15, 3, 9]

    Notes:
        - Requires the `shuf` command-line tool, available on Unix-based systems.
        - The random numbers generated will be between 1 and 20 inclusive.
        - May raise an error if `shuf` is not available or if the subprocess fails.
